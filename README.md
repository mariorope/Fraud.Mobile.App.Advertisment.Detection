# Fraud.Mobile.App.Advertisment.Detection

This project was developed during my studies in the course Big Data Analytics with R and Azure2.0, offered by Data Science Academy (www.datascienceacademy.com.br).

This project provides a simple predictive model to support the fraud detection in traffic of clicks on mobile applications advertising. Three algorithms, including Random Forest, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were tested in this project.

It is relevant to mention that the train dataset was not used during the development of the model because the data set contains too much data to be processed in my machine, especially using R for this purpose. Therefore, the model creation was based on the train_sample data set.
